# C PROGRAMMING `0x00. C - Hello, World`

### Note: When doing this project, After using text editor of your choice to create and access the file on insert mode.Ensure the first line is always having `#!/bin/bash`, then the second line is having the correct command/answer.
(From your terminal, convert the file created to `SCRIPT` i.e: chmod u+x filename)



This project is the first C project as part of the alx_africa curriculum, and covers the very basics of compilation and C.

## 0. Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
* File> 0-preprocessor: is a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
### input: `gcc -E $CFILE -o c`

## 1. Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
* File> 1-compiler: is a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
### input: `gcc -c $CFILE`

## 2. Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
* File> 2-assembler: is a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
### input: `gcc $CFILE -S`

## 3. Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
* File>> 3-name: is a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
### input: `gcc $CFILE -o cisfun`

## 4. Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.
* File>> 4-puts.c: is a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
### input: check inside the file `4-puts.c` to see code.

## 5. Write a C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art`, followed by a new line.
* File> 5-printf.c: is a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.
### input: check inside the file `5-printf.c` to see code.

## 6. Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
* File> 6-size.c: is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
### input: check inside the file `6-size.c` to see code.

## 7. Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
File 100-intel is a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

## 8. Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
File 101-quote.c is a C program that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line, to the standard error.
