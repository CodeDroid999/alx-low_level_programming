# PROJECT 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105258746/190835047-aa8ab3e3-4e8a-4302-a215-8af869289b9e.png)

#### Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as â€œloop inside loop"
`(A nested loop is a loop inside the body of another loop)`

- Note: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
~ You have to start by creating your `main.h` first.
```
main.h file is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
```

- `File: 0-isupper.c` is a function that checks for uppercase character.

- `File: 1-isdigit.c` is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- `File: 2-mul.c` is a function that multiplies two integers.

- `File 3-print_numbers.c` is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- `File 4-print_most_numbers.c` is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- `File 5-more_numbers.c` is a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

- `File 6-print_line.c` is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

- `File 7-print_diagonal.c` is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

- `File 8-print_square.c` is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

- `File 9-fizz_buzz.c` is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints Buzz.

- `File 10-print_triangle.c` is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

- `File 100-prime_factor.c` is a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

- `File 101-print_number.c` is a function that prints an integer using only _putchar().

- `File _putchar.c` contains the _putchar() function definition.
